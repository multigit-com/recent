This Python script replicates the functionality of the Bash script. Here's a breakdown of its key components:

1. We use `argparse` to handle command-line arguments, allowing users to specify the search path and maximum depth.

2. The `list_recent_readmes` function does the main work:
   - It calculates the date one month ago.
   - It walks through the directory structure using `os.walk()`.
   - It checks the depth of each directory and stops if it exceeds the maximum depth.
   - For each README.md file found, it checks if it was modified in the last month.
   - It stores the results in a list of tuples (modification time, folder path).

3. After collecting all results, it sorts them by date and prints them in the required format.

To use this script:

1. Save it to a file, for example, `list_recent_readmes.py`.
2. Run it from the command line:
   - With default values: `python list_recent_readmes.py`
   - With a specific path: `python list_recent_readmes.py /path/to/your/directory`
   - With a specific path and depth: `python list_recent_readmes.py /path/to/your/directory --max-depth 5`

The output will be in the same format as the Bash script:
```
YYYY-MM-DD /path/to/folder
```

This Python script offers the same functionality as the Bash script but might be more portable across different operating systems and easier to modify or extend for users more familiar with Python. It also provides a more structured way of handling command-line arguments using `argparse`.
